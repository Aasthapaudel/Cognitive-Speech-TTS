# General Domain Script 

The general domain script on this directory can be used to record and train custom neural voice.

These example scripts provided by Microsoft are for the voice recording process. These scripts are prepared following the native reading conventions so it's easier for the voice talent to read, for example "50%" (read as 'fifty percent') and "$45" (read as "forty-five dollars").

To use these example scripts for training, it's recommended that you should do the sanity check to make sure it matches what the voice talent actually speaks in the audio and normalize the text before uploading the data. For example, change '50%' to fifty percent and '$45' to forty-five dollars. Normalization should apply to the scripts that contain digits, symbols, abbreviations, date, and time.
