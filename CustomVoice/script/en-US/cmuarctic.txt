0000000000	Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.
0000000001	Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.
0000000002	For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
0000000003	Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
0000000004	Will we ever forget it.
0000000005	God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
0000000006	And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
0000000007	Gad, your letter came just in time.
0000000008	He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.
0000000009	I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
0000000010	If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
0000000011	Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
0000000012	He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
0000000013	Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
0000000014	It's the aurora borealis.
0000000015	There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
0000000016	From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
0000000017	There was a change now.
0000000018	I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
0000000019	Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
0000000020	It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
0000000021	Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
0000000022	A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
0000000023	It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
0000000024	I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
0000000025	It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
0000000026	To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
0000000027	Robbery, bribery, fraud, 
0000000028	Their forces were already moving into the north country.
0000000029	I had faith in them.
0000000030	They were three hundred yards apart.
0000000031	Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
0000000032	He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.
0000000033	Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
0000000034	He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
0000000035	She turned in at the hotel.
0000000036	I was the only one who remained sitting.
0000000037	We'll have to watch our chances.
0000000038	The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
0000000039	I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
0000000040	Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
0000000041	How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
0000000042	It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
0000000043	Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
0000000044	He moved away as quietly as he had come.
0000000045	The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
0000000046	Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
0000000047	He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.
0000000048	Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
0000000049	In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
0000000050	The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.
0000000051	It was a curious coincidence.
0000000052	Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
0000000053	There was nothing on the rock.
0000000054	Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
0000000055	Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
0000000056	I have no idea, replied Philip.
0000000057	I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
0000000058	His immaculate appearance was gone.
0000000059	Anyway, no one saw her like that.
0000000060	Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
0000000061	The men stared into each other's face.
0000000062	Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
0000000063	The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
0000000064	They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
0000000065	He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
0000000066	Surely I will excuse you, she cried.
0000000067	In a flash Philip followed its direction.
0000000068	It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
0000000069	He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
0000000070	What was the object of your little sensation.
0000000071	But who was Eileen's double.
0000000072	The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them.
0000000073	And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him.
0000000074	There has been a change, she interrupted him.
0000000075	The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
0000000076	It is the fire, partly, she said.
0000000077	Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her.
0000000078	It was a large canoe.
0000000079	What if Jeanne failed him.
0000000080	What if she did not come to the rock.
0000000081	His face was streaming with blood.
0000000082	A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
0000000083	Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
0000000084	A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
0000000085	Death had come with terrible suddenness.
0000000086	Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.
0000000087	He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling.
0000000088	The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
0000000089	The singing voice approached rapidly.
0000000090	His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
0000000091	He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.
0000000092	For a full minute he crouched and listened.
0000000093	He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
0000000094	A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
0000000095	Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
0000000096	Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
0000000097	Shall I carry you.
0000000098	A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
0000000099	You must sleep, he urged.
0000000100	You, you would not keep the truth from me.
0000000101	He will follow us soon.
0000000102	But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
0000000103	She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
0000000104	Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe.
0000000105	The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
0000000106	If you only could know how I thank you.
0000000107	He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
0000000108	Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
0000000109	Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
0000000110	Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
0000000111	He was wounded in the arm.
0000000112	I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
0000000113	Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
0000000114	He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
0000000115	Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
0000000116	She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
0000000117	Pierre obeys me when we are together.
0000000118	Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
0000000119	My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
0000000120	They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
0000000121	Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
0000000122	She had died from cold and starvation.
0000000123	It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
0000000124	He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
0000000125	Each day she became a more vital part of him.
0000000126	It was a temptation, but he resisted it.
0000000127	This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
0000000128	Her face was against his breast.
0000000129	She was his now, forever.
0000000130	Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
0000000131	A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
0000000132	Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
0000000133	He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
0000000134	I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre.
0000000135	About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
0000000136	Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
0000000137	In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
0000000138	He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
0000000139	Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
0000000140	It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
0000000141	Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
0000000142	Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.
0000000143	But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
0000000144	I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.
0000000145	Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.
0000000146	A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
0000000147	Now these things had been struck dead within him.
0000000148	For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
0000000149	Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
0000000150	And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare.
0000000151	Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
0000000152	MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
0000000153	He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
0000000154	Won't you draw up, gentlemen.
0000000155	A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
0000000156	He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
0000000157	Does that look good.
0000000158	They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
0000000159	You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
0000000160	Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
0000000161	That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.
0000000162	Philip made no effort to follow.
0000000163	He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne.
0000000164	They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
0000000165	Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
0000000166	I was near the cabin, and saw you.
0000000167	Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
0000000168	Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
0000000169	There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
0000000170	And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen.
0000000171	Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
0000000172	The date was nearly eighteen years old.
0000000173	They were the presage of storm.
0000000174	Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
0000000175	For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
0000000176	She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
0000000177	Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
0000000178	Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
0000000179	If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed.
0000000180	So cheer up, and give us your paw.
0000000181	This time he did not yap for mercy.
0000000182	And the air was growing chilly.
0000000183	Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two.
0000000184	The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
0000000185	Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
0000000186	Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
0000000187	Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
0000000188	The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
0000000189	Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
0000000190	For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
0000000191	He did not rush in.
0000000192	It was edged with ice.
0000000193	He drank of the water cautiously.
0000000194	But a strange thing happened.
0000000195	He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
0000000196	Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose.
0000000197	Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
0000000198	Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
0000000199	He leapt again, and the club caught him once more.
0000000200	He cried, and swung the club wildly.
0000000201	She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
0000000202	They were following the shore of a lake.
0000000203	The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
0000000204	From now on we're pals.
0000000205	He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
0000000206	How much was it.
0000000207	Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.
0000000208	It was not a large lake, and almost round.
0000000209	Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
0000000210	It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
0000000211	Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman.
0000000212	Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
0000000213	Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
0000000214	They die out of spite.
0000000215	The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
0000000216	Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive.
0000000217	The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
0000000218	At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
0000000219	A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
0000000220	I don't know why you're here at all.
0000000221	What part of the United States is your home.
0000000222	My, I'm almost homesick for it already.
0000000223	She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist.
0000000224	I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
0000000225	That came before my A B C's.
0000000226	It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
0000000227	But it contributed to the smash.
0000000228	The last one I knew was an overseer.
0000000229	Do you know any good land around here.
0000000230	The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
0000000231	I cannot follow you, she said.
0000000232	I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
0000000233	Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
0000000234	His voice was passionately rebellious.
0000000235	Don't you see I hate you.
0000000236	So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
0000000237	It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
0000000238	He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
0000000239	Wash your hands of me.
0000000240	I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
0000000241	I saw it when she rolled.
0000000242	I only read the quotations.
0000000243	He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
0000000244	Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
0000000245	You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
0000000246	They ought to pass here some time today.
0000000247	I had been sad too long already.
0000000248	All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
0000000249	He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
0000000250	I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
0000000251	O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
0000000252	He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
0000000253	Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
0000000254	You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.
0000000255	See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
0000000256	They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
0000000257	Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
0000000258	Think of investing in such an adventure.
0000000259	Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all.
0000000260	I have been doubly baptized.
0000000261	They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
0000000262	Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed.
0000000263	And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.
0000000264	The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
0000000265	They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
0000000266	Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow.
0000000267	Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
0000000268	That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
0000000269	And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
0000000270	Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
0000000271	You can take a vacation on pay.
0000000272	They are big trees and require plenty of room.
0000000273	And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
0000000274	There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
0000000275	Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
0000000276	McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
0000000277	It would give me nervous prostration.
0000000278	She said with chattering teeth.
0000000279	I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
0000000280	I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
0000000281	If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
0000000282	The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant.
0000000283	There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
0000000284	But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
0000000285	Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
0000000286	Keep an eye on him.
0000000287	Those are my oysters, he said at last.
0000000288	They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued.
0000000289	One by one the boys were captured.
0000000290	The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted.
0000000291	Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred.
0000000292	They were deep in the primeval forest.
0000000293	He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
0000000294	And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
0000000295	Bassett was a fastidious man.
0000000296	There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
0000000297	This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
0000000298	I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
0000000299	From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
0000000300	But all my dreams violated this law.
0000000301	It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis.
0000000302	But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
0000000303	I graduated last of my class.
0000000304	They had no fixed values, to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
0000000305	He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
0000000306	Very early in my life, I separated from my mother.
0000000307	His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
0000000308	White Leghorns, said Mrs Mortimer.
0000000309	Massage under tension, was the cryptic reply.
0000000310	Therefore, hurrah for the game.
0000000311	It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
0000000312	Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
0000000313	Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
0000000314	Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
0000000315	We had been chased by them ourselves, more than once.
0000000316	He was a wise hyena.
0000000317	Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
0000000318	And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom.
0000000319	With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
0000000320	The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
0000000321	This is a common experience with all of us.
0000000322	He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
0000000323	It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
0000000324	Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
0000000325	Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
0000000326	They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements.
0000000327	The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves.
0000000328	Ah, indeed.
0000000329	Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
0000000330	Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
0000000331	Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
0000000332	This is no place for you.
0000000333	He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
0000000334	Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
0000000335	So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
0000000336	Encouraged by my conduct, Big-Face became a sudden ally.
0000000337	The fighting had now become intermittent.
0000000338	They obeyed him, and went here and there at his commands.
0000000339	It was like the beating of hoofs.
0000000340	Why, doggone you all, shake again.
0000000341	Seventeen, no, eighteen days ago.
0000000342	You mean for this State, General, Alberta.
0000000343	He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality.
0000000344	She was trying to pass the apron string around him.
0000000345	Get down and dig in.
0000000346	They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
0000000347	They only lifted seven hundred and fifty.
0000000348	It was simple, in its way, and no virtue of his.
0000000349	Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.
0000000350	It was more like sugar.
0000000351	I'm sure going along with you all, Elijah.
0000000352	Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.
0000000353	Fresh meat they failed to obtain.
0000000354	A burst of laughter was his reward.
0000000355	You don't catch me at any such foolishness.
0000000356	A month passed by, and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.
0000000357	They continued valiantly to lie, but the truth continued to outrun them.
0000000358	Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
0000000359	But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
0000000360	But he did not broach it, preferring to mature it carefully.
0000000361	Nope, not the slightest idea.
0000000362	It is not an attempt to smash the market.
0000000363	We have plenty of capital ourselves, and yet we want more.
0000000364	These rumors may even originate with us.
0000000365	A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.
0000000366	There is not an iota of truth in it, certainly not.
0000000367	I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings.
0000000368	In partnership with Daylight, the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.
0000000369	He saw all men in the business game doing this.
0000000370	It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal.
0000000371	He saw only the effect in a general, sketchy way.
0000000372	Points of view, new ideas, life.
0000000373	But life's worth more than cash, she argued.
0000000374	The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.
0000000375	Your price, my son, is just about thirty per week.
0000000376	This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place.
0000000377	That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged.
0000000378	How old are you, daddy.
0000000379	But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth.
0000000380	My name's Ferguson.
0000000381	Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man.
0000000382	To his surprise, her answer was flat and uncompromising.
0000000383	The farmer works the soil and produces grain.
0000000384	That's what Carnegie did.
0000000385	I can't argue with you, and you know that.
0000000386	Bob, growing disgusted, turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab.
0000000387	It was my idea to a tee.
0000000388	Mab, she said.
0000000389	I'll go over tomorrow afternoon.
0000000390	But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.
0000000391	There is that magnificent Bob, eating his head off in the stable.
0000000392	Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.
0000000393	It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
0000000394	As for himself, weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.
0000000395	A rising tide of fat had submerged them.
0000000396	Call me that again, he murmured ecstatically.
0000000397	In the car were Unwin and Harrison, while Jones sat with the chauffeur.
0000000398	And here's another idea.
0000000399	Manuel had one besetting sin.
0000000400	The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club.
0000000401	Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside.
0000000402	His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.
0000000403	Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
0000000404	It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.
0000000405	And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
0000000406	Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
0000000407	The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.
0000000408	He could feel a new stir in the land.
0000000409	So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
0000000410	It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand.
0000000411	There is another virtue in these bulkheads.
0000000412	But I am at the end of my resources.
0000000413	Now our figuring was all right.
0000000414	It lasted as a deterrent for two days.
0000000415	The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.
0000000416	It is also an insidious, deceitful sun.
0000000417	The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
0000000418	The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian.
0000000419	When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.
0000000420	By golly, the boy wins.
0000000421	Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider.
0000000422	McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu.
0000000423	Obviously, it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
0000000424	Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.
0000000425	They do not know the length of time of incubation.
0000000426	Enters now the psychology of the situation.
0000000427	It was not exactly a deportation.
0000000428	Quick was the disappointment in his face, yet smiling was the acquiescence.
0000000429	Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance.
0000000430	Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk.
0000000431	The boy at the wheel lost his head.
0000000432	To her the bridge was tambo, which is the native for taboo.
0000000433	A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds.
0000000434	What do you mean by this outrageous conduct.
0000000435	But Martin smiled a superior smile.
0000000436	By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
0000000437	At sea, Monday, March 16, 1908.
0000000438	At sea, Wednesday, March 18, 1908.
0000000439	Yes, sir, I corrected.
0000000440	Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.
0000000441	You live on an income which your father earned.
0000000442	He was worth nothing to the world.
0000000443	Then you don't believe in altruism.
0000000444	The creative joy, I murmured.
0000000445	He deluged me, overwhelmed me with argument.
0000000446	Ah, it is growing dark and darker.
0000000447	I was Hump, cabin boy on the schooner Ghost.
0000000448	A sinewy hand, dripping with water, was clutching the rail.
0000000449	No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
0000000450	I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.
0000000451	Three oilers and a fourth engineer, was his greeting.
0000000452	Eighteen hundred, he calculated.
0000000453	The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.
0000000454	I obeyed, and a minute or two later they stood before him.
0000000455	But it won't continue, she said with easy confidence.
0000000456	What I saw I could not at first believe.
0000000457	The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell.
0000000458	There's too much of the schoolboy in me.
0000000459	I had forgotten their existence.
0000000460	Ah, we were very close together in that moment.
0000000461	But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.
0000000462	They are his tongue, by which he makes his knowledge articulate.
0000000463	Between the rush of the cascades, streaks of rust showed everywhere.
0000000464	He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage.
0000000465	Captain West may be a Samurai, but he is also human.
0000000466	And so early in the voyage, too.
0000000467	In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius.
0000000468	The eastern heavens were equally spectacular.
0000000469	He spat it out like so much venom.
0000000470	I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically.
0000000471	He is too keenly intelligent, too sharply sensitive, successfully to endure.
0000000472	The night was calm and snowy.
0000000473	I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born.
0000000474	His outstretched arm dropped to his side, and he paused.
0000000475	At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder.
0000000476	Wada, Louis, and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed.
0000000477	Also, she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room.
0000000478	I tried to read George Moore last night, and was dreadfully bored.
0000000479	Tom Spink has a harpoon.
0000000480	Nimrod replied, with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness.
0000000481	And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out.
0000000482	Beyond dispute, Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes.
0000000483	No-sir-ee.
0000000484	Each insult added to the value of the claim.
0000000485	For the rest, he was a mere automaton.
0000000486	The river bared its bosom, and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness.
0000000487	Their love burned with increasing brightness.
0000000488	They were artists, not biologists.
0000000489	Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked.
0000000490	And as in denial of guilt, the one-legged boy replied.
0000000491	Burnt out like the crater of a volcano.
0000000492	The boy, O'Brien, was specially maltreated.
0000000493	O'Brien took off his coat and bared his right arm.
0000000494	He bore no grudges and had few enemies.
0000000495	And Tom King patiently endured.
0000000496	King took every advantage he knew.
0000000497	The lines were now very taut.
0000000498	And right there I saw and knew it all.
0000000499	Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury.
0000000500	You're joking me, sir, the other managed to articulate.
0000000501	Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai.
0000000502	His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy.
0000000503	He was an athlete and a giant.
0000000504	We fished sharks on Niihau together.
0000000505	The Claudine was leaving next morning for Honolulu.
0000000506	In short, my joyous individualism was dominated by the orthodox bourgeois ethics.
0000000507	Soon shall it be thrust back from off prostrate humanity.
0000000508	Yet, in accordance with Ernest's test of truth, it worked.
0000000509	Much more Ernest told them of themselves and of his disillusionment.
0000000510	There is more behind this than a mere university ideal.
0000000511	No, it is a palace, wherein there are many servants.
0000000512	We must give ourselves and not our money alone.
0000000513	We are consumed in our own flesh-pots.
0000000514	But here amongst ourselves let us speak out.
0000000515	Also, there was awe in their faces.
0000000516	Out of abstractions Ernest had conjured a vision and made them see it.
0000000517	Illuminating oil was becoming all profit.
0000000518	Such an act was in direct violation of the laws of the land.
0000000519	He was fond of quoting a fragment from a certain poem.
0000000520	Without them he could not run his empire.
0000000521	For such countries nothing remained but reorganization.
0000000522	They could not continue their method of producing surpluses.
0000000523	At once would be instituted a dozen cooperative commonwealth states.
0000000524	The Oligarchy wanted violence, and it set its agents provocateurs to work.
0000000525	Nowhere did the raw earth appear.
0000000526	The lush vegetation of that sheltered spot make a natural shield.
0000000527	Men who endure it, call it living death.
0000000528	As I say, he had tapped the message very rapidly.
0000000529	Ask him, I laughed, then turned to Pasquini.
0000000530	In what bucolic school of fence he had been taught was beyond imagining.
0000000531	May drought destroy your crops.
0000000532	Dunham, can your boy go along with Jesse.
0000000533	But Johannes could, and did.
0000000534	A new preacher and a new doctrine come to Jerusalem.
0000000535	He would destroy all things that are fixed.
0000000536	He was an enthusiast and a desert dweller.
0000000537	What Pascal glimpsed with the vision of a seer, I have lived.
0000000538	I should like to engage just for one whole life in that.
0000000539	Yea, so are all the lesser animals of today clean.
0000000540	The Warden with a quart of champagne.
0000000541	Without a doubt, some of them have dinner engagements.
0000000542	I had been born with no organic, chemical predisposition toward alcohol.
0000000543	He may anticipate the day of his death.
0000000544	The Italian rancho was a bachelor establishment.
0000000545	I lost my balance and pitched head foremost into the ooze.
0000000546	Men like Joe Goose dated existence from drunk to drunk.
0000000547	Also, churches and preachers I had never known.
0000000548	Do you know that we weigh every pound of coal we burn.
0000000549	This also became part of the daily schedule.
0000000550	All an appearance can know is mirage.
0000000551	Yet he dreams he is immortal, I argue feebly.
0000000552	I am writing these lines in Honolulu, Hawaii.
0000000553	Jack London, Waikiki Beach, Honolulu, Oahu.
0000000554	Jerry was so secure in his nook that he did not roll away.
0000000555	Why, he's bought forty pounds of goods from you already.
0000000556	The last refugee had passed.
0000000557	And the foundation stone of service, in his case, was obedience.
0000000558	Peace be unto you and grace before the Lord.
0000000559	His mouth opened; words shaped vainly on his lips.
0000000560	Bill lingered, contemplating his work with artistic appreciation.
0000000561	What the flaming.
0000000562	Mrs McFee's jaws brought together with a snap.
0000000563	Then it is as I said, Womble announced with finality.
0000000564	With them were Indians, also three other men.
0000000565	Dennin's hands were released long enough for him to sign the document.
0000000566	Now Irvine was a man of impulse, a poet.
0000000567	He was just bursting with joy, joy over what.
0000000568	At Lake Linderman I had one canoe, very good Peterborough canoe.
0000000569	Behind him lay the thousand-years-long road across all Siberia and Russia.
0000000570	He had forgotten to build a fire and thaw out.
0000000571	I never saw anything like her in my life.
0000000572	There was no law on the Yukon save what they made for themselves.
0000000573	Good business man, Curly, O'Brien was saying.
0000000574	There weren't any missions, and he was the man to know.
0000000575	And the big Persian knew of his existence before he did of hers.
0000000576	Once the jews harp began emitting its barbaric rhythms, Michael was helpless.
0000000577	But we'll just postpone this.
0000000578	There was the Emma Louisa.
0000000579	This is my fifth voyage.
0000000580	It was this proposition that started the big idea in Daughtry's mind.
0000000581	Daughtry elaborated on the counting trick by bringing Cocky along.
0000000582	Enjoy it he did, but principally for Steward's sake.
0000000583	I have long noted your thirst unquenchable.
0000000584	Wonder if he's a lion dog, Charles suggested.
0000000585	We don't see ourselves as foolish.
0000000586	He had comparatively no advantages at first.
0000000587	He had proved it today, with his amateurish and sophomoric productions.
0000000588	I was sick once -- typhoid.
0000000589	In a way he is my protege.
0000000590	We are both children together.
0000000591	It's only his indigestion I find fault with.
0000000592	She'd make a good wife for the cashier.
0000000593	Gad, do I remember it.
0000000594	You got out by fighting, and I through a pretty girl.
0000000595	I can see that knife now.
0000000596	When I can't see beauty in woman I want to die.
0000000597	His slim fingers closed like steel about Philip's.
0000000598	He seized Gregson by the arm and led him to the door.
0000000599	Hear the Indian dogs wailing down at Churchill.
0000000600	Burke himself had criticized it because of the smile.
0000000601	I'd say there was going to be a glorious scrap.
0000000602	He turned the map to Gregson, pointing with his finger.
0000000603	His eyes never took themselves for an instant from his companion's face.
0000000604	Something that Whittemore had not yet said thrilled him.
0000000605	Lakes and rivers, hundreds of them, thousands of them.
0000000606	Whitefish, Gregson, whitefish and trout.
0000000607	They robbed me a few years later.
0000000608	He chuckled as he pulled out his pipe and began filling it.
0000000609	Everything was working smoothly, better than I had expected.
0000000610	I was completely lost in my work.
0000000611	His slim hands gripped the edges of the table.
0000000612	He made no reply as he waited for Whittemore to continue.
0000000613	Philip dropped back into his chair.
0000000614	If I was out of the game it would be easily made.
0000000615	MacDougall, my engineer, believes it.
0000000616	It is growing, every day, every hour.
0000000617	Now, you understand.
0000000618	You have associated with some of these men.
0000000619	And there's no chivalry, no quarter shown in this fight.
0000000620	Lord Fitzhugh is the key to the whole situation.
0000000621	All operations have been carried on from Montreal and Toronto.
0000000622	Gregson held a lighted match until it burnt his fingertips.
0000000623	Gregson had seated himself under the lamp and was sharpening a pencil.
0000000624	He caught himself with a jerk.
0000000625	How does your wager look now.
0000000626	He confessed that the sketch had startled him.
0000000627	After all, the picture was only a resemblance.
0000000628	He wondered, too, where Roscoe was.
0000000629	Philip knew that she was not an Indian.
0000000630	In her haste to get away she had forgotten these things.
0000000631	Philip took a step toward Gregson, half determined to awaken him.
0000000632	The thought set his blood tingling.
0000000633	But if Pierre did not return, until tomorrow.
0000000634	Ten minutes had not elapsed since he had dropped the handkerchief.
0000000635	It won't be for sale.
0000000636	For a few moments he ate in silence.
0000000637	Philip did not pursue the subject.
0000000638	Philip produced a couple of cigars and took a chair opposite him.
0000000639	Suppose you saw me at work through the window.
0000000640	He looked like one who had passed through an uncomfortable hour or two.
0000000641	There was nothing more, except a large ink blot under the words.
0000000642	All this day Gregson remained in the cabin.
0000000643	The sixth day he spent in the cabin with Gregson.
0000000644	The flush was gone from her face.
0000000645	That is why I am, am rattled, he laughed.
0000000646	He understood the meaning of the look.
0000000647	She was even more beautiful than when I saw her, before.
0000000648	I'll give a thousand if you produce her, retorted Gregson.
0000000649	They have won popular sentiment through the newspapers.
0000000650	We must achieve our own salvation.
0000000651	In moments of mental energy Philip was restless.
0000000652	He would keep his faith with Gregson for the promised day or two.
0000000653	Something about it seemed to fascinate him, to challenge his presence.
0000000654	Now it was missing from the wall.
0000000655	He boiled himself some coffee and sat down to wait.
0000000656	I'm going down there with you, and I'm going to fight.
0000000657	Now have you got anything to say against me, Mr Philip.
0000000658	If I meet her again I shall apologize, said Eileen.
0000000659	Below him the shadow was broken into a pool of rippling starlight.
0000000660	Only the chance sound had led him to observe them.
0000000661	Could the incident have anything to do with Jeanne and Pierre.
0000000662	There was no chance to fire without hitting him.
0000000663	There was no answer from the other side.
0000000664	Then he hastened on, as Pierre had guided him.
0000000665	With these arguments he convinced himself that he should go on alone.
0000000666	Yet, behind them there was another and more powerful motive.
0000000667	In that case he could not miss them, if he used caution.
0000000668	Before Philip could recover himself Jeanne's startled guards were upon him.
0000000669	It is the nearest refuge.
0000000670	There was pride and strength, the ring of triumph in his voice.
0000000671	The truth of it set Jeanne quivering.
0000000672	Tomorrow it will be strong enough for you to stand upon.
0000000673	You were going to leave after you saw me on the rock.
0000000674	He bit his tongue, and cursed himself at this fresh break.
0000000675	In it there was something that was almost tragedy.
0000000676	Your face is red with blood.
0000000677	Her eyes smiled truth at him as he came up the bank.
0000000678	He can care for himself.
0000000679	They will search for us between their camp and Churchill.
0000000680	Until I die, he exclaimed.
0000000681	Her beautiful hair was done up in shining coils.
0000000682	The Churchill narrowed and its current became swifter as they progressed.
0000000683	For a full half minute Jeanne looked at him without speaking.
0000000684	I want to die in it.
0000000685	Darkness hid him from Jeanne.
0000000686	And yet if she came he had no words to say.
0000000687	He heard a sound which brought him quickly into consciousness of day.
0000000688	Within himself he called it no longer his own.
0000000689	Besides, that noise makes me deaf.
0000000690	Philip looked back from the crest and saw Jeanne leaning over the canoe.
0000000691	Fifty yards ahead of her were the first of the rocks.
0000000692	There was one chance, and only one, of saving Jeanne.
0000000693	You're a devil for fighting, and will surely win.
0000000694	I'll only be in the way.
0000000695	He lifted his eyes, and a strange cry burst from his lips.
0000000696	Shooting pains passed like flashes of electricity through his body.
0000000697	I know that you are in charge there, and Jeanne knows.
0000000698	For a full minute the two men stared into each other's face.
0000000699	He was sure, now, of but few things.
0000000700	It was a miracle, and I owe you my life.
0000000701	Philip ate lightly of the food which Pierre had ready for him.
0000000702	Such men believe, when they come together.
0000000703	The journey was continued at dawn.
0000000704	Jeanne and Pierre both gazed toward the great rock.
0000000705	There was something pathetic in the girl's attitude now.
0000000706	He moved his position, and the illusion was gone.
0000000707	For two hours not a word passed between them.
0000000708	I have hunted along this ridge, replied Philip.
0000000709	That's Thorpe's, said the young engineer.
0000000710	We saw your light, and thought you wouldn't mind a call.
0000000711	Billinger may arrive in time.
0000000712	There's the hitch, replied Thorpe, rolling a cigarette.
0000000713	I want my men to work by themselves.
0000000714	Philip saw MacDougall soon after his short talk with Thorpe.
0000000715	Neither could they understand the growing disaffection among Thorpe's men.
0000000716	Two weeks passed, and in that time Thorpe left camp three times.
0000000717	It was the third or fourth time that Philip had heard MacDougall swear.
0000000718	Blood was oozing slowly from the wounded man's right breast.
0000000719	He destroyed everything that had belonged to the woman.
0000000720	Philip bent low over Pierre.
0000000721	Did Thorpe go to see any one in Churchill.
0000000722	She saw the answer in his face.
0000000723	Thorpe and his men were to destroy this camp, and kill you.
0000000724	There is no need of further detail, now -- for you can understand.
0000000725	There followed a roar that shook the earth.
0000000726	Blind with rage, he darted in.
0000000727	In it was the joy of life.
0000000728	Swiftly his eyes measured the situation.
0000000729	But this little defect did not worry him.
0000000730	And then, steadily, he began to chew.
0000000731	Together they ate the rabbit.
0000000732	They edged nearer, and stood shoulder to shoulder facing their world.
0000000733	It was beating and waiting in the ambush of those black pits.
0000000734	Something vastly more thrilling had come into it now.
0000000735	It took him half an hour to reach the edge of it.
0000000736	But there was no longer the mother yearning in his heart.
0000000737	Besides, had he not whipped the big owl in the forest.
0000000738	After all, it was simply a mistake in judgment.
0000000739	Had it struck squarely it would have killed him.
0000000740	The Indian even poked his stick into the thick ground spruce.
0000000741	Pebbles and dirt flew along with hair and fur.
0000000742	And he was filled with a strange and foreboding fear.
0000000743	It was steel, a fisher trap.
0000000744	OW, a wild dog, he growled.
0000000745	He was a pariah; a wanderer without a friend or a home.
0000000746	That is the strange part of it.
0000000747	His freshly caught furs he flung to the floor.
0000000748	For that reason Le Beau had chosen him to fight the big fight.
0000000749	In the crib the baby sat up and began to prattle.
0000000750	She obeyed, shrinking back with the baby in her arms.
0000000751	His teeth shut with a last click.
0000000752	It was over when he made his way through the ring of spectators.
0000000753	In a flash he was on his feet, facing him.
0000000754	He thought he saw a shudder pass through the Factor's shoulders.
0000000755	The moon had already begun its westward decline.
0000000756	They laughed like two happy children.
0000000757	He pulled, and the log crashed down to break his back.
0000000758	Fast, but endure.
0000000759	A little before dawn of the day following, the fire relief came.
0000000760	The Indian felt the worship of her warm in his heart.
0000000761	He drew in a deep breath as he looked at them.
0000000762	Then he shouted, Shut up.
0000000763	He changed his seat for a steamer reclining chair.
0000000764	On the far corner of the compound fence a hawk brooded.
0000000765	To these he gave castor oil.
0000000766	Hatred and murder and lust for revenge they possessed to overflowing.
0000000767	Sheldon glanced at the thermometer.
0000000768	I'll see to poor Hughie.
0000000769	Her gray eyes were flashing, and her lips were quivering.
0000000770	Also, I want information.
0000000771	Let them go out and eat with my boys.
0000000772	I, I beg pardon, he drawled.
0000000773	And you preferred a cannibal isle and a cartridge belt.
0000000774	I was in New York when the crash came.
0000000775	No, I did not fall among thieves.
0000000776	Such things in her brain were like so many oaths on her lips.
0000000777	Your being wrecked here has been a godsend to me.
0000000778	I can't go elsewhere, by your own account.
0000000779	Her achievements with cocoanuts were a revelation.
0000000780	He glanced down at her helplessly, and moistened his lips.
0000000781	That is what distinguishes all of us from the lower animals.
0000000782	Idealism led him to philosophic anarchy, and his family threw him off.
0000000783	He also contended that better confidence was established by carrying no weapons.
0000000784	Outsiders are allowed five minute speeches, the sick man urged.
0000000785	So was Packard's finish suicide.
0000000786	Joan cried, with shining eyes.
0000000787	Nobody knows how the natives got them.
0000000788	How can you manage all alone, Mr Young.
0000000789	The planters are already considering the matter.
0000000790	I use great trouble advisedly.
0000000791	Dear Sir, Your second victim has fallen on schedule time.
0000000792	We leave the eventuality to time and law.
0000000793	I also understand that similar branch organizations have made their appearance in Europe.
0000000794	Society is shaken to its foundations.
0000000795	A month in Australia would finish me.
0000000796	Down through the perfume weighted air fluttered the snowy fluffs of the cottonwoods.
0000000797	You were destroying my life.
0000000798	Horses and rifles had been her toys, camp and trail her nursery.
0000000799	I'm as good as a man, she urged.
0000000800	You read the quotations in today's paper.
0000000801	He's terribly touchy about his black wards, as he calls them.
0000000802	Whatever he guessed he locked away in the taboo room of Naomi.
0000000803	This is eighteen eighty.
0000000804	Death is and has been ever since old Maui died.
0000000805	Some boy, she laughed acquiescence.
0000000806	Let us talk it over and find a way out.
0000000807	It is a good property, and worth more than that.
0000000808	I wish you were more adaptable, Joan retorted.
0000000809	Such is my passage engaged on the steamer.
0000000810	The issue was not in doubt.
0000000811	Well, there are better men in Hawaii, that's all.
0000000812	Harry Bancroft, Dave lied.
0000000813	It's a Yankee, Joan cried.
0000000814	He was the leader, and Tudor was his lieutenant.
0000000815	They likewise are disinclined to being eaten.
0000000816	But to culture the Revolution thus far had exhausted the Junta.
0000000817	The President of the United States was his friend.
0000000818	Your face was the personification of duplicity.
0000000819	Shorty turned to their employers.
0000000820	You were engaged.
0000000821	I saw it all myself, and it was splendid.
0000000822	Now run along, and tell them to hurry.
0000000823	What's that grub-thief got to do with it.
0000000824	It was a superb picture.
0000000825	So she said, the irate skipper dashed on.
0000000826	And watch out for wet feet, was his parting advice.
0000000827	Raoul yelled, in order to make himself heard.
0000000828	Oolong was two hundred and fifty miles from the nearest land.
0000000829	They just lay off in the bush and plugged away.
0000000830	The very thought of the effort to swim over was nauseating.
0000000831	And there was a dog that barked.
0000000832	There are four, all low, McCoy answered.
0000000833	The women they carried away with them to the Big Valley.
0000000834	The Japanese understood as we could never school ourselves or hope to understand.
0000000835	They had been on the same lay as ourselves.
0000000836	You are positively soulless, he said savagely.
0000000837	Harrison is still my chauffeur.
0000000838	The boy grew and prospered.
0000000839	He wanted to give the finish to this foe already so far gone.
0000000840	Exciting times are the lot of the fish patrol.
0000000841	I know they are my oysters.
0000000842	By this time Charley was as enraged as the Greek.
0000000843	They must have been swept away by the chaotic currents.
0000000844	It resembled tea less than lager beer resembles champagne.
0000000845	The very opposite is true; they are discouraged vagabonds.
0000000846	At the same time spears and arrows began to fall among the invaders.
0000000847	Then, again, Tudor had such an irritating way about him.
0000000848	Outwardly, he maintained a calm and smiling aspect.
0000000849	Tudor surveyed him with withering disgust.
0000000850	You fired me out of your house, in short.
0000000851	Her mouth opened, but instead of speaking she drew a long sigh.
0000000852	It's worth eight dollars.
0000000853	And he did hurt my arm.
0000000854	Saxon's onto her job.
0000000855	Only once did I confide the strangeness of it all to another.
0000000856	But this time it was Saxon who rebelled.
0000000857	I was not to cry out in the face of fear.
0000000858	And now put yourself in my place for a moment.
0000000859	The boy threw back his head with pride.
0000000860	Saxon nodded, and the boy frowned.
0000000861	Why not like any railroad station or ferry depot.
0000000862	We could throw stones with our feet.
0000000863	It was put together in a casual, helter-skelter sort of way.
0000000864	These were merely stout sticks an inch or so in diameter.
0000000865	Then it was that a strange thing happened.
0000000866	From the source of light a harsh voice said.
0000000867	But I did not enjoy it long.
0000000868	We were now good friends.
0000000869	Two of the Folk were already up.
0000000870	Now animals do not like mockery.
0000000871	He gave one last snarl and slid from view among the trees.
0000000872	Again the girls applauded, and Mrs Hall cried.
0000000873	Just the same I'd sooner be myself than have book indigestion.
0000000874	Some of the smaller veins had doubtless been ruptured.
0000000875	But we were without this momentum.
0000000876	There was one difficulty, however.
0000000877	The hyena proceeded to dine.
0000000878	The time was considered auspicious.
0000000879	Or have they already devised one.
0000000880	We would not spend another such night.
0000000881	At first his progress was slow and erratic.
0000000882	He placed his paw on one, and its movements were accelerated.
0000000883	The awe of man rushed over him again.
0000000884	The Fire-Men wore animal skins around their waists and across their shoulders.
0000000885	Between him and all domestic animals there must be no hostilities.
0000000886	For a much longer time Lop-Ear and I remained and watched.
0000000887	All right, Sir, replied Jock with great regret.
0000000888	At times I wondered where Sir Archibald got his style.
0000000889	Why should a fellow throw up the sponge after the first round.
0000000890	His hand shot out and clutched Crooked-Leg by the neck.
0000000891	Miss Brodie's smile was slightly sarcastic.
0000000892	Does the old boy often go off at half-cock that way.
0000000893	A flying arrow passed between us.
0000000894	I pulled, suddenly, with all my might.
0000000895	Here we allow our solicitors to look after our legal work.
0000000896	His previous wives had never lived long enough to bear him children.
0000000897	It was our river emerging like ourselves from the great swamp.
0000000898	Cameron looked at his hands with their long, sinewy fingers.
0000000899	We got few vegetables and fruits, and became fish eaters.
0000000900	We never made another migration.
0000000901	Nor was Elam Harnish an exception.
0000000902	A little treatment, massage, with some help from the doctor.
0000000903	The 29th very foggy.
0000000904	Dig in; you're sure good, was Daylight's answer.
0000000905	The apron string loomed near and he shied like an unbroken colt.
0000000906	He had been born with this endowment.
0000000907	And this was their sole conversation throughout the meal.
0000000908	Though the aurora still flamed, another day had begun.
0000000909	He did not believe in the burning of daylight for such a luxury.
0000000910	Again he had done the big thing.
0000000911	Daylight was tired, profoundly tired.
0000000912	The regret in his voice was provocative of a second burst of laughter.
0000000913	Instead, he arrived on the night of the second day.
0000000914	Their supply of grub was gone.
0000000915	Crickets began to chirp, and more geese and ducks flew overhead.
0000000916	Not till the twentieth of May did the river break.
0000000917	It was a gigantic inadequacy.
0000000918	Our Mr Howison will call upon you at your hotel.
0000000919	He had been so easy.
0000000920	Change chairs, Daylight commanded.
0000000921	I'd sooner have my chips back.
0000000922	They only had a little thirty thousand dollar fire.
0000000923	His partners had starved and died on the Stewart.
0000000924	As to how she dressed, he had no ideas at all.
0000000925	It does, was her audacious answer.
0000000926	Oh, it's just a novel, a love story.
0000000927	Whoever lived on the ranch did that.
0000000928	How old are you, mother.
0000000929	Here he got a fresh thrill.
0000000930	It was unobtrusive, yet it was there.
0000000931	Well, I'll be plumb gosh darned.
0000000932	These quick little joys of hers were sources of joy to him.
0000000933	I play that choice wide open to win.
0000000934	Each improvement makes the value of everything else pump up.
0000000935	But how are you going to do it.
0000000936	Lots of men take women buggy riding.
0000000937	Daylight made no answer, and the door closed behind him.
0000000938	There's not an iota of truth in it.
0000000939	But ever his gaze returned to that Crouched Venus on the piano.
0000000940	Would you be satisfied with that one hundredth part of me.
0000000941	In such a tumbling of values was no time to sell.
0000000942	Stand off butcher and baker and all the rest.
0000000943	Matthewson, who's this bookkeeper, Rogers.
0000000944	Now just what do you want to know.
0000000945	I want to know how all this is possible.
0000000946	It's that much junk.
0000000947	There was proper division of labor in the work they individually performed.
0000000948	He loved to play Chinese lottery.
0000000949	The Law of Club and Fang
0000000950	The temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole trip.
0000000951	And as never before, he was ready to obey.
0000000952	This state of mind comes of an undue prominence of the ego.
0000000953	There are the canals of China, and the Yang-tse River.
0000000954	We threaten to be of the one mind before the voyage is completed.
0000000955	She was built primarily to sail.
0000000956	In the Bohemian Club of San Francisco there are some crack sailors.
0000000957	My age, in years, is twenty two.
0000000958	I forgot how easily I had taught myself from the printed page.
0000000959	Any average young fellow can teach himself in a week.
0000000960	Please do not think that I already know it all.
0000000961	You see, we were teaching ourselves.
0000000962	And now behold the perversity of things.
0000000963	Yield yourself to the waters that are ripping and tearing at you.
0000000964	Mr McVeigh told me about him.
0000000965	Unlike Joshua, he stood in no need of divine assistance.
0000000966	To say the least, Captain Cook was a rather thorough going empiricist.
0000000967	Man could not conquer them.
0000000968	Thought I, and a worthy fool he proved.
0000000969	A scarlet loincloth completed his costume.
0000000970	I like to speculate upon the glorious future of man.
0000000971	Christmas is an easy problem compared with a Polynesian giving-feast.
0000000972	He had peeled off his shirt and was wildly waving it.
0000000973	And how would we ever find ourselves.
0000000974	I defy any man to get a Solomon Island sore in California.
0000000975	A bush chief had died a natural death.
0000000976	The skipper's and Nakata's gymnastics served as a translation without words.
0000000977	Last night he showed all the symptoms of coming down with pneumonia.
0000000978	My idea was that he would have more influence over the natives.
0000000979	It is merely the simple superlative.
0000000980	I made no more overtures.
0000000981	Among my minor afflictions, I may mention a new and mysterious one.
0000000982	The voyage was our idea of a good time.
0000000983	At sea, Tuesday, March 17, 1908.
0000000984	Yes, sir, he answered, with cheerful alacrity.
0000000985	I was still weak from my prolonged immersion.
0000000986	The boy hesitated, then mastered his temper.
0000000987	I was beneath the water, suffocating and drowning.
0000000988	The pain from my hurt knee was agonizing.
0000000989	The hunters were still arguing and roaring like some semi-human amphibious breed.
0000000990	I have been robbed, sir, I amended.
0000000991	You were looking squeamish this afternoon, he began.
0000000992	How could I answer the question on the spur of the moment.
0000000993	I learned it myself in English ships.
0000000994	An altruistic act is an act performed for the welfare of others.
0000000995	Knowing him, I review the old Scandinavian myths with clearer understanding.
0000000996	Yes, and no, sir, was the slow reply.
0000000997	And each year something happened, and I did not go.
0000000998	How in hell did he know it was you in the dark.
0000000999	Of course much grumbling went on, and little outbursts were continually occurring.
0000001000	You have all the advantage.
0000001001	The dirk mentioned by Wolf Larsen rested in its sheath on my hip.
0000001002	Have you ever earned a dollar by your own labour.
0000001003	He gave no reason, but his motive was obvious enough.
0000001004	Ah, it was sweet in my ears.
0000001005	He may desire to escape pain, or to enjoy pleasure.
0000001006	It was impossible to hoist sail and claw off that shore.
0000001007	There was nothing for us but the wide raw ocean.
0000001008	I arose obediently and went down the beach.
0000001009	The next thing to watch out for is bed sores.
0000001010	At that moment I got the impression that she was willowy.
0000001011	Your father's fifth command, he nodded.
0000001012	On occasion, on this traverse, the Cape Verde Islands are raised.
0000001013	She is essentially the life-giving, life-conserving female of the species.
0000001014	This was when the explosion occurred.
0000001015	Also, at regular intervals, he would mutter.
0000001016	It is a very tenable hypothesis, and will bear looking into.
0000001017	There were orange-green, gold-green, and a copper-green.
0000001018	The Gabriel voice of the Samurai rang out.
0000001019	The sunsets grow more bizarre and spectacular off this coast of the Argentine.
0000001020	The history of our westward-faring race is written in it.
0000001021	And the Eurasian Chinese-Englishman bowed himself away.
0000001022	They were babbling and chattering all together.
0000001023	Too much, he told me, with ominous rolling head.
0000001024	He is a candidate, rising from the serf class to our class.
0000001025	We are cooking on the coal stove and on the oil burners.
0000001026	The steward has just tendered me a respectful bit of advice.
0000001027	Well, did they eat.
0000001028	Famine had been my great ally.
0000001029	Nowhere in the North is the soil so prolific.
0000001030	They ran the canoe in and climbed the high earth bank.
0000001031	The land exchanged its austere robes for the garb of a smiling wanton.
0000001032	There were stir and bustle, new faces, and fresh facts.
0000001033	And there was Ethel Baird, whom also you must remember.
0000001034	He had become a man very early in life.
0000001035	I did not think you would be so early.
0000001036	He did not know what went on in the minds of his superiors.
0000001037	Mops, sir, eagerly answered the sailor at the wheel.
0000001038	Some one had thrust a large sheath-knife into his hand.
0000001039	O'Brien emitted a shriek that sank swiftly to a gurgling sob.
0000001040	Sandel would never become a world champion.
0000001041	Also, she wouldn't walk.
0000001042	To my dearest and always appreciated friend, I submit myself.
0000001043	You used to joyride like the very devil.
0000001044	They saw each other for the first time in Boston.
0000001045	Isaac Ford, the austere soldier of the Lord, the old hypocrite.
0000001046	Eighteen, he added.
0000001047	His reward should have been peace and repose.
0000001048	He was an amphibian and a mountaineer.
0000001049	It was sanctification and salvation.
0000001050	The history of the eighteenth century is written, Ernest prompted.
0000001051	They are not biologists nor sociologists.
0000001052	The more his opponents grew excited, the more Ernest deliberately excited them.
0000001053	By virtue of that power we shall remain in power.
0000001054	One guess will do, Ernest retorted.
0000001055	Take my advice and accept the vacation.
0000001056	I could not agree with Ernest.
0000001057	But such divergence of opinion would constitute no menace to society.
0000001058	It is dog eat dog, and you ate them up.
0000001059	Let us run them for ourselves.
0000001060	It was introduced by Representative Dick of Ohio.
0000001061	Very few people knew of the existence of this law.
0000001062	The very thing, Ernest agreed.
0000001063	Also a fellow Senator, Chauncey Depew, said.
0000001064	Ernest saw in the affair the most sinister import.
0000001065	Then there was the campaign.
0000001066	He was manifestly distressed by my coming.
0000001067	Not a wheel moved in his empire.
0000001068	The reorganization of these countries took the form of revolution.
0000001069	You're going in for grab sharing.
0000001070	The Oligarchy will encourage such ambition and the consequent competition.
0000001071	Violation of this law was made a high misdemeanor and punished accordingly.
0000001072	Without discussion, it was the agents provocateurs who caused the Peasant Revolt.
0000001073	The task we set ourselves was threefold.
0000001074	Many other similar disconcerting omissions will be noticed in the Manuscript.
0000001075	The flower of the artistic and intellectual world were revolutionists.
0000001076	This the Iron Heel foresaw and laid its schemes accordingly.
0000001077	The mob came on, but it could not advance.
0000001078	But why continue the tirade, for tirade it was.
0000001079	After all superfluous flesh is gone what is left is stringy and resistant.
0000001080	Beyond refusing to sell us food, they left us to ourselves.
0000001081	He was a merry monarch, especially so for an Asiatic.
0000001082	What an excited whispering and conferring took place.
0000001083	Jacob Brinker, who was his roadmate, brought the news.
0000001084	Thus he turned the tenets and jargon of psychology back on me.
0000001085	You yellow giant thing of the frost.
0000001086	Never so strange a prophet came up to Jerusalem.
0000001087	We who have endured so much surely can endure a little more.
0000001088	I have seen myself that one man contemplated by Pascal's philosophic eye.
0000001089	One great drawback to farming in California is our long dry summer.
0000001090	I remembered the red wine of the Italian rancho, and shuddered inwardly.
0000001091	I said, and dismissed the matter as not worth thinking about.
0000001092	Then came my boy code.
0000001093	And wherever I ranged, the way lay along alcohol-drenched roads.
0000001094	And as we hurried up town, Joe Goose explained.
0000001095	The scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land.
0000001096	The life there was healthful and athletic, but too juvenile.
0000001097	How valiantly I went at it that first day.
0000001098	It would help to tide me along until I got steady employment.
0000001099	Did I possess too much vitality.
0000001100	In his anxiety and solicitude and love they did not count.
0000001101	He had fulfilled his duty and paid properly.
0000001102	He knew what taboos he was violating.
0000001103	Do you value your hide.
0000001104	You should have seen them when they heard me spitting Chinook.
0000001105	He plodded on for half an hour, when the hallucination arose again.
0000001106	Tomorrow or next day it might he gone.
0000001107	But already he had composed himself.
0000001108	Zilla relaxed her sour mouth long enough to sigh her satisfaction.
0000001109	Eggshell is not good to eat.
0000001110	But there was also talk of witchcraft in the village.
0000001111	Yea, I will tell thee.
0000001112	Hans hurled himself upon the prostrate man, striking madly with his fists.
0000001113	And he thought of Oona, and of her words.
0000001114	Nor would it thaw out his hands and feet.
0000001115	The Russian music player, the Count, was her obedient slave.
0000001116	So far as flags were concerned, they were beyond all jurisdiction.
0000001117	New idea, he volunteered, brand new idea.
0000001118	Thirty pounds, said the captain with finality.
0000001119	The very idea of it was preposterous.
0000001120	Captain Doane's orders were swiftly obeyed.
0000001121	Come on, Del Mar challenged.
0000001122	He had a big chimpanzee that was a winner.
0000001123	I am sure it must have been some adventure.
0000001124	That Longfellow chap most likely had written countless books of poetry.
0000001125	His abnormal power of vision made abstractions take on concrete form.
0000001126	I'll tell you, the librarian said with a brightening face.
0000001127	He read his fragments aloud.
0000001128	Typhoid -- did I tell you.
0000001129	But she had become an automaton.
0000001130	At the best, they were necessary accessories.
0000001131	You were making them talk shop, Ruth charged him.
